Here is test 1 of `code-includes`:

``` rust
// A test file to be included in 
fn fib(n: u32) -> u32 {
    match n {
        0 => 1,
        1 => 1,
        _ => fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2),
    }
}
```

Here is test 2 of `code-includes`:

``` {.rust .memes .others}
// A test file to be included in 
fn fib(n: u32) -> u32 {
    match n {
        0 => 1,
        1 => 1,
        _ => fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2),
    }
}
```
