# Todo

- Add line number and maybe even regex options to `code-includes.lua`.
- Improve on `oldschool.lua`. Check out `gutenberg` extension for pandoc.
- Maybe don't check for valid language name in `standard-code.lua`? Just use the first
  class name, that's what cmark does after all.

  - Can get rid of m4 usage.
